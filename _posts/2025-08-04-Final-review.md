We first learned what cancer was and launched out github blog. We got to research a cancer that we would use for examples for the rest of the 
course. Installed Jupyter Notebook and plotted functions to see how prices has changed with the rise of modern technology. We got to see how 
scientists graphed the entire human genome and cutting costs for future projects. Our third lesson, we discussed genoms and medicine. We 
discussed that genome doesnt fully deterime who a person is as the enviorment around also affects ones development. We also learned about 
personalized medicine as every person reacts differently to drugs. Our 6th lesson, we learned about Cancer cell lines and how they are used. 
We also learned about different cancer subtypes based on gene expressions. Our last lesson, we learned about cell search and how cancer cells 
can be detected. Some of the ways were through cell search, liquid biopsy, and parsotix. I think that the last lesson was the most interesting
lesson as we got to learn ways that could detect cancer cells earlier. The hardest one to understant was our sixth lesson because it was hard to
understand the different subtypes.

Today we learned how the human genome project was done. We also learned how it has impacted the cost of sequencing DNA. Over the years, due the genome project, costs of sequencing has drastically dropped. It once costed 10000 dollars to sequence 1 mbp. Now it costs 0.01 dollars to sequence. With modern day technology, sequencing data has become more effecient and has allowed cheaper and faster sequencing. We also learning how the Genome was proccessed. Scientists used the sanger method which is a DNA sequencing technique that uses modified nucleotides called dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) to terminate DNA strand elongation at specific bases, producing fragments of varying lengths. By running these fragments through gel electrophoresis, the DNA sequence can be read from the shortest to the longest fragment. This method is slow because the max amount of base pairs was only 1000. With modern technology, the max amount of base pairs has increased to the billions.
